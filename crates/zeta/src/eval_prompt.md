Your task is to help me grade code test output.

Here is the **Actual** test output:

```
<actual>
```

Here is what I expected it to look like:

```
<expected>
```

Now, help me score the **Actual** test output using the following criteria:

<assertions>

Based on these criteria, give the **Actual** test output a score between 0.0 and 1.0.

If the **Actual** output does not contain any of the text I said it "must" include, grade it

In your reply, perform a short, succinct analysis of how the criteria fit the actual output.

Finally, on the last line of your response, give me a grade as a single, floating-point number. Nothing else.
